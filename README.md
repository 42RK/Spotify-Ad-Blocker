EZBlocker
=========

EZBlocker is a Spotify Ad Blocker. It's a program that I quickly put together with VB.NET and has been tested on Windows 7 and 8.

For a general description, visit http://www.ericzhang.me/spotify-ad-blocker/

The goal of EZBlocker is to be the most stable Spotify Ad Blocker for Windows. Like other ad blockers, it mutes Spotify when an ad is playing. EZBlocker uses nircmd to control volume. It does not attempt to modify or perform actions onto Spotify itself, so there are no glitches found in other ad blockers (ie: not being able to minimize the Spotify window, random resizing of the Spotify window).

Changelog:

	- Add auto blacklist adding mechanism
